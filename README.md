This repository contains the different versions of the program throughout the semester in the smart systems subject of 2019.

The files are ordered by (VersionNumber)_ (Name)_ (Description), so for example, 01_discTracking_Tutorial.py would be the first version of
the discTracking program, consisting largely of the initial tutorial code. 02_discTracking_PrelimCoordSystem would be the second version
of the discTracking program, consisting of preliminary coordinate system code, and so on.

11_DiscTracking_BasicDefense.py is currently the latest version of the program.

In the "Test files" folder, files that were used for testing / experimentation can be found, and parts of those files can at times be
found in the main program. The "trackingByColor.py" program, for example, forms the basis of the masking functionality of our main program.
