The files are ordered by (VersionNumber)_ (Name)_ (Description), so for example, 01_discTracking_Tutorial.py would be the first version of
the discTracking program, consisting largely of the initial tutorial code. 02_discTracking_PrelimCoordSystem would be the second version
of the discTracking program, consisting of preliminary coordinate system code, and so on.

11_DiscTracking_BasicDefense.py is currently the latest version of the program.
